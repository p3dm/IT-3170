/**
 * Write a C program to perform some queries on a telco data (comming from stdin) with the following format:
 * The first block of data consists of lines (terminated by a line containing #), each line (number of lines can be up to 100000) is under the form:
 *         call <from_number> <to_number> <date> <from_time> <end_time>
 * which is a call from the phone number <from_number> to a phone number <to_number> on <date>, and starting at time-point <from_time>, terminating at time-point <end_time>
 * <from_number> and <to_number> are string of 10 characters (a phone number is correct if it contains only digits 0,1,...,9, otherwise, the phone number is incorrect)
 * <date> is under the form YYYY-MM-DD (for example 2022-10-21)
 * <from_time> and <to_time> are under the form hh:mm:ss (for example, 10:07:23)
 *
 * The second block consists of queries (terminated by a line containing #), each query in a line (number of lines can be up to 100000) and belongs to one of the following types:
 * ?check_phone_number: print to stdout (in a new line) value 1 if no phone number is incorrect
 * ?number_calls_from <phone_number>: print to stdout (in a new line) the number of times a call is made from <phone_number>
 * ?number_total_calls: print to stdout (in a new line) the total number of calls of the data
 * ?count_time_calls_from <phone_number>: print to stdout (in a new line) the total time duration (in seconds) the calls are made from <phone_number>
 *
 * Example
 * Input
 * call 0912345678 0132465789 2022-07-12 10:30:23 10:32:00
 * call 0912345678 0945324545 2022-07-13 11:30:10 11:35:11
 * call 0132465789 0945324545 2022-07-13 11:30:23 11:32:23
 * call 0945324545 0912345678 2022-07-13 07:30:23 07:48:30
 * #
 * ?check_phone_number
 * ?number_calls_from 0912345678
 * ?number_total_calls
 * ?count_time_calls_from 0912345678
 * ?count_time_calls_from 0132465789
 * #
 *
 * Output
 * 1
 * 2
 * 4
 * 398
 * 120
